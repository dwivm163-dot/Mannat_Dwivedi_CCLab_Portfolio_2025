  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I’m Mannat, a Design & Technology student at Parsons. I’m interested in creative technology, interactive art, and how code can be used as a design tool.</p>

  <p>Outside of class, I enjoy exploring New York City, street art,experimenting with visual design, music and fashion.</p>

  <p>My career interests include creative coding, design, and storytelling across digital and physical media. This portfolio collects the work I made for Critical Computation Lab this semester.</p>
