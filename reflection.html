  <h1>Reflection on Critical Computation Lab</h1>

  <p>This page reflects on what I learned in Critical Computation Lab this semester.</p>

  <p>Over the course of the class, I became more comfortable with p5.js, thinking about code as a creative medium, and building small interactive sketches. I learned how variables, conditionals, loops, and functions can be used to structure visual ideas and interactive behaviors.</p>

  <p>It also helped me see connections between coding, design, and my other studio projects, like translating concepts into visual systems, clocks, games, and data portraits.</p>
